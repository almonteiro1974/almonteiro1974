I am an AI Manager at Banco do Brasil. Master in BI. I am available to share experiences. During my Technologist graduation, I wrote as an end-of-course project a dissertation/program that was about a school secretary system. In the Post-graduation Lato sensu of Database, I wrote a dissertation about Webmining. Professionally, I can report knowledge of DB2 UDB, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Mysql and Postgresql database infrastructure support acquired while I was working as an IT analyst in the database area at Banco do Brasil. Another knowledge acquired at Banco do Brasil was electronic document management, mainly based on the infrastructure support of IBM's EDM products - Content Manager and OnDemand. To conclude, I acquired knowledge in decision support tools (SAS, Microstrategy, OBIEE, Spotfire) and Big Data when I was a support team manager in these areas.
